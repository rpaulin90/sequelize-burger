# sequelize-burger

Built using Express JS, Node JS, Handlebars JS, MySQL, and Sequelize (ORM) while following the MVC design pattern.

This simple application lets the user enter the name of as many burgers as they want. These burgers are stored in a database and displayed on the screen with a "Devour!" button next to each name and a text input field to put the name of a customer. If the button is clicked, that burger name is hidden and displayed on the opposite side along with the name of the customer that ate the burger.
